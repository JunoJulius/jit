        <p>
          If you have been using HTML for any time at all you know that every bit of HTML needs to be wrapped in <mark>html</mark> tags. An opening <mark>html</mark> tag should appear first and a closing <mark>html</mark> tag should appear at the bottom of the document. Every other bit of HTML should appear between those two tags.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <mark>head</mark> element is the first element to appear after the opening <mark>html</mark> tag. In the document <mark>head</mark> we place things like the page <mark>title</mark> and <mark>meta</mark> data, we add JavaScript to our page with the <mark>script</mark> tag, and we <mark>link</mark> to external stylesheets and other resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          On most webpages the <mark>head</mark> element is a very busy place. It is used to provide information about a web page to web browsers and search engines, and to link external resources to the page. It does not contain content that is visible on the web page. Metadata is data about data. It is information that describes some other information in a meaninful way. The <mark>meta</mark> tag is used in an HTML document to provide high level metadata about the web page: information that describes the web page in a meaningful way that can be understood by web crawlers and browsers. The page <mark>title</mark> is used as the name of the web page when it appears on a search engine results page (SERP). The <mark>title</mark> is also used as a label for the browser window or tab where the web page is loaded. Another element that is used by virtually every modern website is the <mark>link</mark> element. This element is used to create and define a relationship between a web page and an external resource or another web page.
          <mark>Link</mark> elements can be used to pull in Stylesheets to define the visual presentation of a web page; An icon file, to be used in the browser title bar or when the web page is bookmarked; Attribution resources such as authorship and copyright information.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of the content that is visible on a web page is nested between opening and closing <mark>body</mark> tags. The body is the primary container of the content that makes up a web page.
          <ul>Most common sections of a document include:
            <li>Header</li>
            <li>Navigation bar</li>
            <li>Main content</li>
            <li>Sidebar</li>
            <li>Footer</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The header is usually a big strip across the top with a big heading and/or logo. This is where the main common information about a website usually stays from one webpage to another. You can make it using a <mark>header</mark> tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          The navigation bar links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another â€” having an inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. It is made with <mark>nav</mark> tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          Main content contains most of the unique content of a given webpage. This is the one part of the website that definitely varies from page to page. You can accentuate it with <mark>main</mark> tag, possibly followed by <mark>article</mark>, <mark>section</mark>, and <mark>div</mark> tags.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc belongs to the sidebar. Usually this is contextual to what is contained in the main content, but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements. Make with a <mark>aside</mark> tag inside the <mark>main</mark>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Footer is generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info, located across the bottom of the page. It's a place to put  information that is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content. Add <mark>footer</mark> tag and it's done!
